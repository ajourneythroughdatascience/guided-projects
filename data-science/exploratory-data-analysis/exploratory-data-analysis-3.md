# Exploratory Data Analysis, Pt. 3
Over the [last two parts](https://pabloagn.com/guided-projects/exploratory-data-analysis-pt-2/) of this 3-segment [Guided Project](https://pabloagn.com/guided-projects), we have introduced some interesting concepts around EDA. We've performed statistical analyses on our client's data set and evaluated multiple classification algorithms. We started with a hypothesis, put it to test, refined our beliefs, came up with some conclusions, and now, it's time to face our client.

In this section, we will learn how to build a business client deliverable using different tools. We will translate all our results into an elegant report which will help with decision execution. We will close this Guided Project with some recommendations on discussing technical results with a non-technical audience.

We'll be using Python scripts which can be found in theÂ [Guided Project Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/guided-projects/tree/master/data-science/exploratory-data-analysis).

The generated plots and test results from the last two segments can also be found in the [plots](https://github.com/pabloagn/guided-projects/tree/master/data-science/exploratory-data-analysis/plots) and [outputs](https://github.com/pabloagn/guided-projects/tree/master/data-science/exploratory-data-analysis/outputs) folder respectively.

## Consolidating the results


## Generating a technical deliverable

### 1. Managing expectations
Before jumping right in we need to have something clear: We might have a high-performing model presenting extremely high accuracy results. Still, if we don't communicate our results properly and translate them into actionable insights, there's a chance that the client won't understand the value behind our hard work.

Although things have changed drastically during the last years, it's common for companies to still not have an established team of data scientists and data analysts, specially when talking about small emerging businesses; managing an internal IT department is already expensive, so there is no assurance that our client will have a dedicated research team behind the curtains. And even if this is the case, there is no guarantee that they will be available for our project.

This is why we need to ensure that we're translating our results to a business-oriented language and not a research-oriented one as a complement to our technical deliverable, specially if we are presenting our findings to a commercial team, which is often the case.

Thankfully, there are some really nice tools out there that will help us achieve our goal.
