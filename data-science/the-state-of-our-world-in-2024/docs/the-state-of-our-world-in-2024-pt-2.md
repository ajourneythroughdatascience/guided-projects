Writing code can be as simple as importing the required libraries, declaring our variables, functions, and classes as required, including some docstrings here and there, some additional comments, executing, and we're done. While we're at it, let's skip the function & class part and drop everything as is. Even better, let's also save some lines by stripping our file from all comments.

# Macroeconomics
According to Britannica, macroeconomics is the study of the behaviour of a national or regional economy as a whole. It is concerned with understanding economy-wide events such as the total amount of goods and services produced, the level of unemployment, and the general behaviour of prices.

Depending on who we ask, there are around 7 schools of macroeconomic thought. If we base ourselves on Edmund S. Phelps' [Seven Schools of Macroeconomic Thought](https://academic.oup.com/book/2854), we can find the following:
- **Keynesian**: The central tenet of this school of thought is that government intervention can stabilize the economy via monetary policies & other actions.
- **Monetarist**: This school maintains that the money supply (*the total amount of money in an economy, in the form of coin, currency, and bank deposits*) is the chief determinant on the demand side of short-run economic activity.
- **New Classical**: This school takes the view that short-run fluctuations in the aggregate economy—the business cycle—can be understood within an equilibrium framework of rational, forward-looking agents.
- **New Keynesian**: This school is an evolution of the Keynesian movement. It comes with two main assumptions. First, that people and companies behave rationally and with rational expectations. Second, it assumes a variety of market inefficiencies – including sticky wages and imperfect competition.
- **Supply-side**: Focuses on influencing the supply of labour and goods, using tax cuts and benefit cuts as incentives to work and produce goods.
- **Neoclassical & Neo-Classical Real Business Cycle**: This theory suggests that business cycles are a result of technological changes and the availability of resources, both of which influence productivity and cause changes in the long-run aggregate supply.
- **Structuralist**: This school emphasizes the importance of taking into account structural features (*typically*) when undertaking economic analysis.

Macroeconomics is not simply explained by a couple of metrics; we're talking about a complex system, so we need to look at it from different optics. This is where metrics under this context come into place; they help us assess the current state of the macroeconomic system, and evaluate on how to move forward.

Some of the most relevant subjects that can help explain & influence macroeconomic phenomena are:
- Fluctuation in Interest Rates
- Productive Output (GPD)
- Aggregate Supply & Demand
- Consumer Prices (CPI)
- Poverty (Poverty Rates)
- Monetary Policies
- Fiscal Policies
- External Debt

In this section we'll take a look at the most relevant. We'll first prepare our document:

We'll import the following libraries:

##### **Code**
```R
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(car)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggalt)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(extrafont)
library(viridis)
```

Next, we'll define some variables & parameters:

```R
# Directories
rDir <- "data/raw/"
w_FigDir <- "outputs/figures"
utilDir <- file.path(rDir, "Utilities")

# Plotting
color_black <- "#1a1a1a"
color_white <- "#f2f2f2"
color_gray <- "gray"

# Set up scheme as Viridis, with n colors
color_scheme <- viridis::viridis(3)

# Set up visualizations theme
theme_set(theme_gray(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Work Sans"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = color_black),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "plain", hjust = 0.5), # Reduced boldness of the title
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray90"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white")
  ))
```

Finally, we'll load all our datasets:

```R
# Load data
df_gdp_nominal <- read_csv(file.path(rDir, "GDP_Nominal/API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_6011335.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
df_gdp_ppp <- read_csv(file.path(rDir, "GDP_PPP/API_NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_5996066.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
df_gdp_pc <- read_csv(file.path(rDir, "GDP_Per_Capita/API_NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_6011310.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
df_gdp_gr <- read_csv(file.path(rDir, "GDP_Growth/API_NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG_DS2_en_csv_v2_5994650.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
df_gdp_pc_gr <- read_csv(file.path(rDir, "GDP_Per_Capita_Growth/API_NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG_DS2_en_csv_v2_5994795.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
```

We can now start discussing each indicator.

## 1. GDP
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been one of the key metrics used by economists & policy makers throughout the years. So much so that a period of recession is marked by changes in GDP. Roughly speaking, it measures the productive output of a given economy under a given span of time, usually annually. Of course, GDP does not tell the whole story of an economy's performance, and economists figured this out long ago. Nonetheless, GDP is still widely used as a main marker for probing an economy.

### 1.1 Nominal GDP 
- **Description**: The Nominal Gross Domestic Product (*Nominal GDP*) is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates.
- **Source**: [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
- **Indicator Code**: NY.GDP.MKTP.CD

We can start by taking a look at the 10 top & bottom countries in terms of Nominal GDP in 2022:




### 1.2 GDP (PPP)


### 1.3 GDP per Capita (PPP)


### 1.4 GDP Growth Rate


### 1.5 GDP per Capita Growth Rate

### 1.6 GNI Star (GNI*)


### Exploring the outliers
- [**Ireland**](https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-gdp-growth-multinationals-misleading/)
	- Even with PPP adjustment, Ireland's GPD has consistently been in the 3 highest spots throughout the last decade, not only in Europe, but in the world. The problem with this approach is that, as we already mentioned, GDP does not strictly account for the money that goes out of the country to other economies. GDP calculates the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period, and while this monetary value can very well be produced from within an economy, it can go out to other economies as well, and this is not accounted for in GDP.
	- Turns out that there are 1,500+ multinational companies operating in Ireland because of the lax corporate taxation scheme. This is similar to what happens in Luxembourg, which we'll review in a second.
	- Moreover, a big fraction of these companies are actually healthcare companies. It makes sense then that Ireland was one of the counted economies that had a positive change in GDP per Capita from 2019 to 2020 (*5.10% increase*).
	- This can be due to:
		- Shift of HQs
		- Shift of capital assets such as technology patents & aircraft fleets.
	- The problems:
		- This provides a misleading picture.
		- Credit ratings agencies assess risk of default, in part, by citing a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio; the lower the ratio, the lower the interest rates, and the higher the capacity for an economy to refinance much of its national debt at record-low rates.
	- Let us explore more in detail which are the main companies by sector.
- [**Guyana**](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/oil-rich-guyana-expects-annual-economic-growth-over-25-coming-years-2023-02-16/)
	- Guyana has been the subject of international news this year due to Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro putting increased pressure on reclaiming Essequibo, [a region discovered to have massive oil deposits in 2015](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67610200).
	- It has also been subject of international attention due to its unusual growth in GDP per Capita. This is directly linked to oil deposit discovery, and particularly in 2020 to the [start-up of its oil export industry](https://repositorio.cepal.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7bfd0d40-230f-445a-a61b-8318a7ecdc19/content).
- [Libya](https://www.bmz.de/en/countries/libya/economic-situation-152402)
	- Libya is also a particular case due to its rapid but volatile GDP per Capita Growth Rate in recent years. If we look at the average growth over the last 10 years, we see around 6.25%, but when we take a look at the standard deviation of these percentual changes (*around 36%*), the history is more interesting. Libya has two main highlights:
		- **Libyan civil war (2014–2020)**: This caused heavy fluctuations in the production capacity...
		- **Almost total dependence on oil & gas**: Libyan economy is strongly made up of oil & gas industry; hydrocarbon production currently makes up around 95% of exports and government revenue, and [about 60% of GDP](https://www.bmz.de/en/countries/libya/economic-situation-152402). This means that a generous part of the monetized productive output of the country is based on oil prices; if prices go up, oil-centric countries perceive profits much closer than other countries with more widely-spread productive activities. On contrast, if prices go down, the economy becomes extremely vulnerable. This is very clear if we see that on 2020, the GDP per Capita Growth Rate was around -30.1%. This matches with the [initial & agressive plummeting of oil prices due to the COVID pandemic](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/will-oil-prices-go-2017.asp). Next, 2021 arrives & a surge in oil demand accompanied by a short of supply due to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This creates a strong increase in GDP PC Growth Rate (*around 29.80%*) and is even more pronounced due to 2020's drastically low numbers.


	- If we base our conclusions regarding economic growth & prosperity on one single indicator (*such as GDP or GDP PC*), we risk

# Conclusions
We've reviewed multiple yet simple mechanisms we can employ to make our code cleaner, more elegant, modular, usable, scalable and safer. These measures can not only help us become better programmers but better collaborators. It will make reading code a pleasure instead of an agonizing process and instantly boost our credibility.
