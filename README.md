## About
This section is about finding a cool project you’d like to replicate and getting your hands dirty.

Keep in mind that this section contains guided projects I design for educational purposes. You can head to the [portfolio-projects](https://github.com/pabloagn/portfolio-projects) repo if you’d like to view my Project Portfolio.

Some projects are adaptations from existing ones, and others are my creations. Either way, the source is specified in each case, and credit is acknowledged where it’s due. Projects are classified by category/topic, difficulty, tech stack used, and approximate execution time. Also, suggested prerequisites are specified in case it applies.
